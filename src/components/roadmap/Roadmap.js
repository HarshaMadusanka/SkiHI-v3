                Once every Project Cat has been minted and is chillin in the
                home of its new owner, we will begin our entrance into the meta
                verse. Will will purchase a meta verse property and build a
                corner for The Project Cats to chill & wreck havoc on. The first
                2000 wallet addresses who mint a Project Cat will get a free NFT
                from the next 3D project by SkyHiLabs. This is currently is
                development and we will release updates along the way for our
                community to see.

                After selling out & revealing, the top ten (Epic) rarity ranked
                project cats will each get 2 ETH. We will announce those wallet
                address winners on our discord 1 week after the reveal is
                completed.

                We will be donating 20% of mint funds to a charitable
                organization. We have a few non-profits in mind and will allow
                our community to vote on which we will donate the 20% to. 50% of
                all royalties will be given back to The Project Cat Holders

                There has been something on the black market that has been
                making the project cats feel very unlike they have ever felt. A
                project cat said he was turning green, one said he was growing a
                3rd arm, and another said he felt like a zombie. Your not going
                to want to miss out on this!
